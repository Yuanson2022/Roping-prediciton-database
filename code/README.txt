Codes available here are in two folders:
1- Python: 
	Euler_FZ.py: Transfer the Euler angles with Bunge convention into one subdomain of Euler space. 
2- Matlab:
	Artificial_orientation_map_generation.m (Main code): Generate in-plane orientation maps close to the actual texture distribution with variable components.
	Characteristic_grain_allocation.m: allocate Cube and Goss in the TD/RD plane.
	MTEX (version 5.6.1) is used to generate random orientations in the main code.
