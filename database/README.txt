File details: 
Five cases in the article are included
-Experimental case 
-Supplementary case 
-Case with initial Texture-I
-Case with initial Texture-II
-Case with initial Texture-III

Contents details:
Each case has eight 3-D orientation maps due to random texture replacement, which is denoted as Rep(i).
Data of each orientation map contains Euler angles with Bunge convention and thickness strain after deformation.
And it is arranged in order of M(TD)×H(ND)×N(RD), M=240 N=120 H=8.
